Your final answer should be one of 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe', wrapped in '```'. (Tip: We recommend choosing 'maybe' only when there is a clear lack of information and it is not possible to make a reasonably high probability answer. If there is no particular reason, it is probably better to choose between 'yes' and 'no'.)"
